When managing containers, obtaining container logs is sometimes necessary in order to gain insight into what is going on inside a container. Kubernetes offers an easy way to view and interact with container logs using the kubectl logs command. Here, we discuss container logs and demonstrate how to access them using kubectl logs.

Relevant Documentation:-
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/

Lesson Reference:-
A sample pod that generates log output every second:

counter.yaml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: count
    image: busybox
    args: [/bin/sh, -c, 'i=0; while true; do echo "$i: $(date)"; i=$((i+1)); sleep 1; done']


Get the container's logs:
kubectl logs counter

For a multi-container pod, specify which container to get logs for using the -c flag:
kubectl logs <pod name> -c <container name>

Save container logs to a file:
kubectl logs counter > counter.log
