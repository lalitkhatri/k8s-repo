In order to practice using some of the monitoring features in Kubernetes, you will need a running metrics server in your cluster. It is not necessary to know how to install the metrics server in order to pass the exam, but you will need to install it in your practice cluster if you are following along. In this lesson, we will go over to quickly and easily install the metrics server in your practice cluster.


Lesson Reference:-
Clone the metrics server repo and install the server using kubectl apply:


cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/satyensingh/metrics-server.git
kubectl apply -f ~/metrics-server/deploy/1.8+/

Once you have installed the metrics server, you can use this command to verify that it is responsive:
kubectl get --raw /apis/metrics.k8s.io/
