Learning Objectives:-
Perform a rolling update of the container version
Roll back to the previous working state


Problem Statement:-
Your company's developers have just finished developing a new version of their candy-themed mobile game. They are ready to update the backend services that are running in your Kubernetes cluster. There is a deployment in the github @ https://github.com/satyensingh/full-kubernetes-training.git managing the replicas for this application. The deployment is called candy-deployment.yaml. You have been asked to create the deployment from the yaml file in your cluster 

Once you have created the deployment, check if the deployment is successully up and running all the replicas.

Now, update the image for the container named candy-ws in this deployment template to a new version, linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3.

After you have updated the image using a rolling update, check on the status of the update to make sure it is working. If it is not working, perform a rollback to the previous state.
